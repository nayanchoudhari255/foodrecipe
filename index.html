 <center><h2>Veg Paneer Biryani </h2></center>
 <p style="margin: 10px; font-size: 20px;">Paneer biryani is a mildly spiced and delicately flavored dum cooked, traditional biryani recipe. Simply moreish and flavorful paneer biryani that pairs beautifully with any raita. A dum cooked biryani takes time to make but the results are always awesome. You can make this tasty biryani on a stove-top or in the oven.</p>

<div id="about"  >
    <center> <h1 style="background-color: lightgray;  padding: 10px;">About</h1></center> 
    <p style="margin: 10px; font-size: 20px;">A traditional Paneer Biryani recipe is a slow cooked layered casserole of paneer cubes in a curd (yogurt) based gravy, fried onions and par-cooked rice flavored with spices, saffron or rose water.

        Any traditionally made biryani will have separate layers of the gravy and rice, utilizing the dum method of cooking. The rice and gravy layers are slow cooked and steamed in a tightly sealed pan or pot, where the steam is unable to escape.
        
        You will find many variations of making paneer biryani that are not only made in a pan but also in a pressure cooker and in the Instant Pot.
        
        This paneer biryani recipe is very unique and different as there is no preparation of any gravy. Here I just marinate the paneer cubes, layer the marinated paneer with cooked rice in a pan. Later cook everything together. Easy, right?
        
        There is no absolutely no need to make any gravy with the paneer. Bonus, the paneer cubes do not become dense or hard since we are not cooking them twice – like frying or cooking in the gravy and adding to the rice while layering.
        
        Yes, easy in a way, but there is some prep work like frying onions (which is also known as birista) and cooking rice.
        
        After these two steps, making this paneer biryani is a breeze. You need to make the layers in a pot or pan and cook the biryani on stovetop or in the oven.
        
        When I had posted this paneer biryani recipe, it was first of its kind in on the web (now I do not know). As usually a paneer biryani is made by first frying the paneer and then cooking it further with gravy or rice.
        
        This paneer biryani has mild, delicate aroma and flavors of the spices. It is not spicy or pungent.</p>

<p style="margin: 20px; font-size: 20px;">


    
<strong>*Rice:</strong> For any biryani recipe I usually prefer aged basmati rice as the grains become fluffy, tender and non-sticky when cooked. Parboiled basmati rice (sella basmati rice) is another rice variety I like to make biryani with. You can make paneer biryani with any long grained variety of non-sticky rice. <br>
<strong>*Adding veggies:</strong> You can add some steamed peas and steamed veggies like carrots, cauliflower, potatoes to the paneer biryani recipe. But you will have to increase the curd and other spices accordingly to accommodate the veggies.<br>
<strong>*Vegan option:</strong> For a vegan version of paneer biryani, use tofu, oil and a dairy free yogurt & milk like cashew or almond milk/yogurt. Avoid soy or peanut yogurt as it gives an after taste.<br>
<strong>*Nuts and dried fruits:</strong> Fried cashews and raisins can be added on top of the rice layers.<br>
<strong>*Whole spices:</strong> I recommend adding all the spices and herbs in the same proportion as listed in this paneer biryani recipe. A only suggestion I offer which will alter the flavor slightly will be to replace caraway seeds (shah jeera) with cumin seeds.

      <h2 style="margin: 20px;"> How to make Paneer Biryani</h2>
      <b style="margin: 20px; font-size: 20px;" >  Soak Rice and Fry Onions</b>



      <ul>
        <li>  1. Rinse basmati rice very well in running fresh water until the starch clears from the water. The water should be clear and not cloudy or opaque. Soak the rice grains in water for 30 minutes.
        
            soaking basmati rice in water in glass bowl</li>
        <li> 2. When the rice is soaking, prep the ingredients for the paneer biryani. Thinly slice 2 medium-sized onions. You will need about ¾ to 1 cup of sliced onions.
        
            Heat 4 tablespoons oil or ghee in a small frying pan and add the sliced onions.
            
         sliced red onions in a pan over simmering oil</li>
        <li>  
            3. Stir and begin to fry the onions until they turn golden. Add one or two pinches of salt for quick browning of the onions. Stir often for uniform browning and fry on a low heat.

        <li>  4. In the below photo, the onions have begun to get golden.   onion becoming golden</li>
        <li>  5. When the onions are golden and caramelized, remove them with a slotted spoon. Place the fried onions on kitchen paper towels and set aside. These crispy golden fried onions are also known as Birista.
        
            Set the oil or ghee in which we fried the onions aside. We will be using this oil or ghee while layering the paneer biryani.

            <li>
                6. Warm ¼ cup milk on stovetop or in the microwave. Add 16 to 18 saffron strands to the milk. Stir and set aside.

            <li>
                7. Whisk ½ cup of whole milk curd (yogurt) in a mixing bowl until smooth. Do not use sour curd as that will make your paneer biryani taste sour.
